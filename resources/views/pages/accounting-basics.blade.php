<h2>Accounting Basics</h2>
<p>This system uses <strong>double-entry bookkeeping</strong>. Every journal entry must have total debits equal to total credits.</p>

<h4>Debits and Credits</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Asset/Expense accounts:</strong> increase with debit, decrease with credit</li>
    <li><strong>Liability/Equity/Revenue accounts:</strong> increase with credit, decrease with debit</li>
</ul>

<p>Use this system to create accounts, record journal entries, and maintain balanced books.</p>
